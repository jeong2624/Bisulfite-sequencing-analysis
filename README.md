## Genomic_data_Science_Class

This is DNA methylation tutorial for Genomic Data Science class in 1st semester, 2022 (Graduate class)

This tutorial consists of preprocessing step, alignment step, differentially methylation analysis step and downstrem analysis step.

It is based on the reference paper. ("Multi-tissue DNA methylation age predictor in mouse", Thomas M. Stubbs et al, Genome Biology, 2017)

#### We used RRBS methylation dataset for DNA methylation tutorial.
This dataset is male C57BL/6-BABR mice.
Tissues (Liver, Lung, Heart and Cortex) were isolated from mice at Newborn, 14weeks, 27weeks and 41weeks.
our dataset is mice cortex tissues.
